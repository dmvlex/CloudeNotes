<h1 align="center">Cloud Notes</h1>

<h2>Why is this app needed?</h2>
<p>I woke up one day and couldn't start my computer. After a few hours of torture, I realized that the problem was in the dead hard drive. Thus, I lost heaps of my educational and not only programming notes.


So, this application makes it possible to quickly and conveniently save files to the cloud storage of the Ya.Disk service.</p>

With it, you can always save your notes to the cloud, or transfer them to another computer in two clicks.

<h2>How to use</h2>
<ol>
  <li> At the first start, you will be prompted to log into your Yandex account. Sign in and allow the app to access your cloud storage.</li>
  <li> Next, go to the settings and select the folder with your notes, or other materials that you want to save on the cloud.(By the way, now you can add files to it using the Drag and Drop area.)</li>
  <li> Now you can upload all your files to the cloud, or if necessary, upload them from the cloud.
<b>(I want to note that when downloading from the cloud, all files will be saved to the same directory from where they are uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, in fact, your files will be replaced with those that are on the cloud)</b></li>
</ol>
